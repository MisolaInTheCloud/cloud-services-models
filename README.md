#1 Identify IaaS, PaaS, SaaS Examples (Daily Interactions)
Problem = Students often struggle to map abstract cloud models to real-world services.
Solution =  Provide relatable examples from daily life.
Examples Table:

Model ||   Example              || Explanation 
IaaS  ||  AWS EC2, DigitalOcean ||   Rent virtual servers to host apps/websites
PaaS	|| Heroku, Google App Engine || Deploy apps without managing servers/networking
SaaS	|| Google Workspace, Slack  || Use ready-to-go software via the internet.
Tip: Encourage students to think of tools they use daily (e.g., Netflix = SaaS, GitHub Codespaces = PaaS).

#2 Research Two Major Cloud Providers
Task: Compare AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## AWS Offerings 
- IaaS: EC2 (Virtual Machines), S3 (Storage)  
- PaaS: Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda (Serverless)  
- SaaS: Amazon Chime, QuickSight  

## GCP Offerings
- IaaS: Compute Engine, Cloud Storage  
- PaaS: App Engine, Cloud Functions  
- SaaS: Google Workspace, Apigee API Management

  #3 Managed Service Setup
  - Chosen Platform: AWS Elastic Beanstalk  
- Steps:
- Login to my AWS.
- Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk & click on Create Application.
- I used a demo template for this environment.
- I created a new Key Pair & new EC2
- I configured my Environment (Auto-scaling, load balancing).

# Troubleshooting
## 4. Environment Failure Analysis  

### **Issue Description**  
[Briefly describe the failure, e.g., "Deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk failed due to misconfigured IAM roles."]  

### **Diagnostic Steps**  
1. **Error Message:**  
 **Logs Reviewed:**  
- AWS CloudWatch Logs  
- Elastic Beanstalk Environment Health Dashboard  
3. **Configuration Checks:**  
- Verified IAM user permissions for Elastic Beanstalk.  
- Validated `app.yaml` syntax for GCP App Engine.  

### **Root Cause**  
- **AWS:** Missing `elasticbeanstalk:CreateApplication` permission in IAM policy.  
- **GCP:** Billing account not linked to the project, blocking resource provisioning.  

### **Resolution**  
- **AWS:** Attached the `AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess` policy to the IAM user.  
- **GCP:** Linked an active billing account to the project via GCP Console.  

### **Screenshots**  
- Include error messages, logs, and post-resolution success screenshots.  
Why This Matters
Learning Objective: Demonstrates problem-solving skills and understanding of cloud platform dependencies (e.g., IAM, billing).

Professional Practice: Mirrors real-world DevOps workflows where debugging is critical.

## Lesson 3: Environment Failure & Debugging  

- **Common Pitfalls:**  
  - Permissions (IAM roles, service accounts).  
  - Billing/Quota limitations.  
  - Configuration typos (e.g., `app.yaml`).  
- **Key Takeaway:**  
  - Always check logs first; 90% of issues are permissions or syntax errors!
