#1 Identify IaaS, PaaS, SaaS Examples (Daily Interactions)
Problem = Students often struggle to map abstract cloud models to real-world services.
Solution =  Provide relatable examples from daily life.
Examples Table:

Model ||   Example              || Explanation 
IaaS  ||  AWS EC2, DigitalOcean ||   Rent virtual servers to host apps/websites
PaaS	|| Heroku, Google App Engine || Deploy apps without managing servers/networking
SaaS	|| Google Workspace, Slack  || Use ready-to-go software via the internet.
Tip: Encourage students to think of tools they use daily (e.g., Netflix = SaaS, GitHub Codespaces = PaaS).
